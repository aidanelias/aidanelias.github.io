I crafted my personal website using HTML for structure, SASS for elegant styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Jekyll, a static site generator, ensured efficient content management, and the website is hosted on GitHub Pages for accessibility. The seamless integration of these technologies delivers the very website that you are viewing this post on. Kind of meta, isn't it? :D
